# Pixel Art Rendering 

For my final project in Computer Science, I am to propose and implement a C++ using Qt, an application which is related to color manipulations. I am to create a program where by an image could be loaded and displayed from any part of my hard-drive and my program should be able to get a second image from the loaded image such that the pixel color of the second image is computed using an average method and the results is displayed as a Pixelized Image. 

## Getting Started





End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
