# Pixel Art Rendering 

For my final project in Computer Science, I am to propose and implement a C++ using Qt, an application which is related to color manipulations. I am to create a program where by an image could be loaded and displayed from any part of my hard-drive and my program should be able to get a second image from the loaded image such that the pixel color of the second image is computed using an average method and the results is displayed as a Pixelized Image. After getting my Pixelized image, I am to get a third image from it where its “big and blurred” pixels will now be represented by a set of images in which I choose from my hard-drive and display the results as my Art Transform Image. 

## Getting Started

I started by performing these goals:
  * Create an interface for the user to interact 
  * Load and Display an image.
  *	Find the average color value of each pixel block of my loaded image and display the results which will be my results for the “Pixelized Image”
  * Save the “Pixelized Image”
  * Load multiple sample images
  *	Access the sample images and calculate the mean of each.
  *	Compare the mean of the each pixel of the second image (Pixelized Image) to these sample images. 
  * Replace the pixel block by the best image found from the sample images and paint it on the position of the pixel block
  *	Display the new image which will be the results for the “Art Transform Image”

## Implementation

* Each goal i acheved i took a picture of the results you can view this in the pictures folder on this repository.

* You will find availble my source code as well.
